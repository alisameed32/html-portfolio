<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>A Passionate Computer Science Student with a Focus on BCI</h2>
<p>I'm Ali Sameed Arbani, a junior computer science student eager to explore the intersection of technology and
  neuroscience. My academic journey has ignited a deep interest in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), and I'm driven to
  develop a BCI-related project for my Final Year Project (FYP).</p>
<p>To realize my vision, I plan to incorporate machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing,
  hardware integration, data science, neuroscience, psychology, and other scientific concepts into my project. However,
  the high cost of hardware presents a significant challenge. As a college student, I'm currently limited by financial
  constraints.</p>
<p>To overcome this hurdle, I've decided to expand my skill set by learning web development and improving my freelancing
  abilities. By acquiring these practical skills, I aim to generate income and invest in the necessary hardware for my
  dream project.</p>
<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing badminton, watching Netflix, studying geopolitics, and learning new
  languages. These hobbies offer a much-needed balance to my studies and fuel my creativity.</p>
